## Assumptions
This documentation assumes that you are already familiar with
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript "Learn JavaScript"),
and some of the tools from the
[latest standards](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/ "Latest JavaScript standards") such as
[classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes "ES2015 Classes")
and [modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import "ES2015 Modules").
The code samples are written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "TypeScript").
Most Currin code can be written with just the latest JavaScript,
using [types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html "TypeScript Types") for dependency injection,
and using [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html "Decorators") for metadata.
